# Autonomys Network Ambassador Program Bylaws

## Preamble

The Autonomys Network Ambassador Program (the "Program") is sponsored by Subspace Foundation ("Sponsor") which governs the Autonomys Network (“Network”). This document governs the Program.

The Program exists to support a thriving Network community. Participants in the Program (”Ambassadors”) act as connectors, educators, promoters, and supporters, fulfilling the Mission of bringing wider awareness of the protocol to the public, educating new community members, providing peer-to-peer support, and generally promoting the protocol and administering the Program to uphold the community values of permission-less, decentralized, and egalitarian engagement. Ambassadors are expected to avoid authoritarian behaviors; participation in the Program is to attract and support the community and the other Ambassadors and must always acknowledge the voluntary participation of all people.

Although the Ambassador Program is not strictly permission-less nor decentralized, it strives to operate in a permission-less and decentralized manner. These Bylaws set out the permissions that are reserved to the Program and the Sponsor, define methods to implement those rights in a decentralized manner, and define the Roles, Teams, and Agreements necessary to implement the Program. Participation in the Program requires explicit consent to these Bylaws. The Bylaws are adopted and open for amendment by a supermajority of the Ambassadors in a General Assembly and the consent of the Sponsor.
