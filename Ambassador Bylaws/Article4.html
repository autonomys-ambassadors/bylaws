<h2 id="article4">Article 4. Decision-Making, Agreements, Conflict Resolution, and Ratification</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Transparency. Decisions must be transparent, meaning they are recorded in sufficient detail to spell out the
    issue that was considered, the decision taken, the decision-making method used, and the result. These records
    shall be available to all Ambassadors at all times, regardless of current membership status.</li>
  <li>Subsidiarity. Unless otherwise specified, decisions should be taken by the smallest group of affected
    Ambassadors or Teams.</li>
  <li>Agreements. Agreements are a Transparent recording of the decisions made by Ambassadors, which may outline the
    rules, policies, procedures, rights, or obligations etc. of Ambassadors. Agreements may be amended or repealed
    by another Agreement.&nbsp;</li>
  <ol>
    <li>Agreements may be proposed by one or more Ambassadors.The proposal must include the Decision-Making Method
      to be used to reach Agreement, and is only considered an Agreement once the decision has been approved
      according to the method.</li>
    <li>According to the principle of Subsidiarity, Ambassadors may make many Agreements that do not require
      integration into the Bylaws but shall be maintained with Transparency by the relevant team or teams.&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li id="section3paragraph3">Agreements that pertain to all the members of more than one Official Team, or that
      pertain to all
      Ambassadors, or that meaningfully impact a large percentage of Ambassadors spanning more than one team, or
      that alter these Bylaws, must be approved in a General Assembly using a Supermajority Decision and the
      Sponsor.</li>
  </ol>
  <li>General Assembly. The membership of the General Assembly shall consist of all Ambassadors that are in Good
    Standing at the time of the Assembly, and shall include Ambassadors not in Good Standing for failure to
    participate in Governance.&nbsp;</li>
  <ol>
    <li>Agenda. Proposals needing a General Assembly vote must first be approved by a majority of the Governance Team.
      Approved items must be publicly announced at least two weeks before a General Assembly vote.</li>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <li>Decision-Making Methods. Decisions shall be made by a specific method specified here, or some other method that
    must be documented by the team using a different method. Any alternative processes must adhere to the principles
    of Transparency and Subsidiarity and must strive to achieve the reasonable consent of those that are affected.
  </li>
  <ol>
    <li>Supermajority Decision. The affirmative vote of at least ⅔+1 of the votes cast is required to approve. At
      least 50% +1 of eligible voters must cast a vote for the decision to be considered valid, and a veto or
      objection vote of at least 10% of the votes cast will cause the decision to fail.</li>
    <li>Majority Decision. The affirmative vote of at least ½+1 of the votes cast&nbsp; is required to approve. At
      least 50% +1 of eligible voters must cast a vote for the decision to be considered valid, and a veto or
      objection vote of at least 10% of the votes cast will cause the decision to fail.</li>
    <li>Plurality Decision. In a vote with more than 2 options, the option with the greatest number of affirmative
      votes is approved. At least 50% +1 of eligible voters must cast a vote for the decision to be considered
      valid, and a veto or objection vote of at least 10% of the votes cast will cause the decision to fail.</li>
    <li>Ranked Choice Decision. In a vote with more than 2 options, each option is ranked in order of preference. If
      no option has a majority, the option with the fewest first-choice votes is eliminated, with the votes being
      redistributed based on their second choices. The process continues until a majority is reached. At least 50%
      +1 of eligible voters must cast a vote for the decision to be considered valid, and a veto or objection vote
      of at least 10% of the votes cast will cause the decision to fail.</li>
    <li>Consent Decision. After presenting the agreement and clarifying any questions, the decision may be approved
      unless there are strong objections based on violations of the values, purpose, or other Agreements, or based
      on significant risk of harm. Objections may be overcome by amending the agreement to compensate for the
      risks such that the objection is withdrawn.</li>
    <li>Decree. Certain decisions may be made by individuals independently - for example, the decision to create an
      Ad hoc Team, or to exclude an Applicant from the Apprentice group. Decree decisions may always be disputed
      through Conflict Resolution.</li>
  </ol>
  <li>Conflict Resolution Process. The Conflict Resolution Team and Process provides a method for appealing decisions
    or confirming violations of Agreements or the Bylaws. The Conflict Resolution Process must admit evidence and
    arguments from all parties to a Complaint, and is responsible to reach a decision as to the Complaint.</li>
  <ol>
    <li>Complaints. A complaint is a document outlining an alleged violation of Agreements or an unjust decision or
      action taken by an Ambassador.&nbsp;</li>
    <li>Initiator. A complaint may be initiated by an Ambassador or by the Sponsor.</li>
    <li>Recusal. A Conflict Resolution Team member must recuse themselves from deliberation and voting on any
      Complaint where they are a party to the complaint, or where they have an interest, except those interests in
      common with all Ambassadors or all members of a Permanent Team. If one or more recusals lead to less than three
      members being eligible to consider a Complaint, then the Complaint shall be sent to the Appellate Conflict
      Resolution Team.</li>
    <li>Complaint Handling. The Conflict Resolution Team shall discuss the merits of the complaint and shall keep an
      open record of key discussion points and the outcome of the deliberation, without attributing any statements to
      any Conflict Resolutions Team member. The team shall render a decision based on a simple majority
      vote, with the Sponsor Representative providing a tie-breaking vote when there is no majority. The vote
      shall be anonymous, with each member providing their decision and a simple statement of their reasoning for
      the decision. The Sponsor vote will be ignored unless there is a tie.&nbsp;</li>
    <li>Recommendation. The Conflict Resolution Team may reach the following outcomes for a Complaint.</li>
    <ol>
      <li>Recommend that Sponsor terminate an Ambassador from the Program.</li>
      <li>Recommend that a Team elects a new Lead Ambassador and that Sponsor demote a Lead Ambassador.</li>
      <li>Recommend the Onboarding and Growth Team re-admit an Applicant.</li>
      <li>Recommend that the relevant Team(s) replace an Agreement or repeal a decision.</li>
      <li>Recommend admission as a new Ambassador, with the then-current new ambassador rights and obligations,
        for an Ambassador formerly terminated from the Program.&nbsp;</li>
      <li>Recommend restoration of an Ambassador to Good Standing in the Program</li>
      <li>Dismiss the complaint without a recommendation of any action.</li>
    </ol>
    <li>Appeal of Recommendation. The person(s) receiving the recommendation of the Conflict Resolution Process, or
      the affected Ambassador(s), may appeal the Recommendation. In the event of an appeal, the Conflict
      Resolution Team for the subsequent term shall be appointed immediately ("Appellate Conflict Resolution Team") so
      that the appeal can be heard quickly, but by the next Conflict Resolution Team. The Conflict Resolution Team that
      hears the appeal may choose to withdraw the recommendation, let the recommendation stand, or make an alternative
      Recommendation.
    </li>
    <li>Failure to Implement Recommendations. If Sponsor or a Team fail to implement the recommendations of the
      Conflict Resolution Team, with no appeal or after a failed appeal, they must explain the decision to a
      General Assembly, and a simple majority vote of the General Assembly may compel compliance with the Conflict
      Resolution Team’s recommendation, subject to <a href="./Article1.html#section3paragraph3">Article 1 Section
        3 Paragraph 3</a>. A supermajority vote of the
      General Assembly may void the Recommendation. A failed vote of the General Assembly shall require
      further
      discussion by the parties involved to attempt to reach an agreement, and may cause amendments to this
      Conflict Resolution Process if resolution is not achieved.</li>
  </ol>
  <li>Ratification. These Bylaws will be initially ratified by the Agreement entered into between each Ambassador and
    the Sponsor. Subsequent ratification of modifications shall be via Supermajority with the consent of the
    Sponsor, as specified in <a href="./Article4.html#section3paragraph3">Article 4 Section 3 Paragraph 3</a>.</li>
