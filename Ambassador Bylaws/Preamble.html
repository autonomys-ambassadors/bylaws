<title>Autonomys Network Ambassador Program Bylaws - Preamble</title>
<h1>Autonomys Network Ambassador Program Bylaws</h1>
<h2 id="preamble">Preamble</h2>
<p>The Autonomys Network Ambassador Program (the "Program") is sponsored by Subspace Foundation ("Sponsor") which
    governs the Autonomys Network (“Network”). This document governs the Program.</p>
<p>The Program exists to support a thriving Network community. Participants in the Program (”Ambassadors”) act as
    connectors, educators, promoters, and supporters, fulfilling the Mission of bringing wider awareness of the protocol
    to the public, educating new community members, providing peer-to-peer support, and generally promoting the protocol
    and administering the Program to uphold the community values of permission-less, decentralized, and egalitarian
    engagement. Ambassadors are expected to avoid authoritarian behaviors; participation in the Program is to attract
    and support the community and the other Ambassadors and must always acknowledge the voluntary participation of all
    people.</p>
<p>Although the Ambassador Program is not strictly permission-less nor decentralized, it strives to operate in a
    permission-less and decentralized manner. These Bylaws set out the permissions that are reserved to the Program and
    the Sponsor, define methods to implement those rights in a decentralized manner, and define the Roles, Teams, and
    Agreements necessary to implement the Program. Participation in the Program requires explicit consent to these
    Bylaws. The Bylaws are adopted and open for amendment by a supermajority of the Ambassadors in a General Assembly
    and the consent of the Sponsor.</p>
