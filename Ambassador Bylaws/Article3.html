<h2 id="article3">Article 3. Teams</h2>
<p>The Program operations shall be conducted by Ambassador Teams, which may be Official Teams established herein or
    other Ad hoc Teams that are created and dissolved from time to time according to the Ambassadors and these
    procedures. Ambassadors may choose to join one or more teams, and are expected to actively participate in at least
    one Official Team.</p>
<ol>
    <li>Official Teams</li>
    <ol>
        <li>Lead Roles. Official teams are allocated one or more Lead Ambassador roles, which may be filled according to
            the Selection of Lead Ambassadors.&nbsp;</li>
        <li>Lead Ambassador Role Allocation. Allocation of additional Lead Roles for existing Official Teams shall be
            proposed by the Team requesting an additional Lead position, and decided by the consent of the Sponsor.</li>
        <li>Official Teams. The Program is made up of the following Official Teams.</li>
        <ol>
            <li>Support &amp; Engineering Team. The Support and Engineering team is responsible for providing both
                direct peer-to-peer support and indirect support through the creation of support materials (e.g.
                articles); gathering information about and helping to investigate and solve technical issues; helping or
                directly participating in the development of the technical aspects of the project. The team also helps
                community members by answering questions in Discord, Telegram and on the Networkâ€™s forum; moderating
                Telegram and Discord channels; and communicating about current releases and important events.</li>
            <li>Content &amp; Education Team. The Education &amp; Content team is responsible to create and continually
                improve a base educational plan for effectively onboarding new Apprentices, including development of
                materials, resources, and documentation on the protocol, Program, and community. The Team also creates
                high-quality content to educate the community about the Network, including informative tweets, articles,
                tutorials, videos, and other content. The Team also cultivates content creators in the community by
                recognizing and promoting users with the Content Creator role.</li>
            <li>Engagement Team. The Engagement Team serves as a critical link in promoting the growth of the Network.
                Its mission is to establish connections and interactions with our extensive community to increase
                awareness of the Network. The Engagement Team actively works on identifying target audiences, segmenting
                key user groups, and developing strategies to attract them to participate in tasks on the Network
                platform. The Team implements initiatives to create and disseminate interesting and high-quality content
                that contributes to the spread of information about the Network, encompassing various platforms and
                social media, including Discord, Telegram, Twitter, and others. The team is responsible to increase the
                number of users and to actively encourage them to be active members of the community and enhance their
                presence on these platforms. The team acts as a voice for the Network, collaborating with other Teams to
                ensure smooth and continuous communication and understanding among all project stakeholders.&nbsp;</li>
            <li>Onboarding and Growth Team. The Onboarding and Growth team is responsible for creating and administering
                the Ambassador selection processes and for the effective introduction and integration of Apprentice and
                new Ambassadors to the Program. Key responsibilities include recruiting new ambassador cohorts, hosting
                events and workshops including Ambassador all-hands sessions, mentoring Apprentice Ambassadors,
                developing Ambassador peer relationships, and working closely with the Content &amp; Education team to
                keep Ambassadors up to date.&nbsp;</li>
            <li>Governance Team. The Governance Team is responsible for creating and maintaining these Bylaws and
                facilitating the operations of the General Assembly and the other structures defined herein. The team is
                responsible for creating transparent systems and processes to implement the bylaws and administer these
                processes, including regularly evaluating adherence to the Ambassador or Lead Ambassador Rights and
                Obligations.&nbsp;</li>
        </ol>
    </ol>
    <li>Ad hoc Teams</li>
    <ol>
        <li>Any Ambassador may create an Ad hoc Team for any initiative that supports the Program Mission by recruiting
            at least two other members.</li>
        <li>Conflict Resolution Team. The Conflict Resolution Team is a permanent Ad hoc Team composed of 5 randomly
            selected representatives from the entire Ambassador membership. The team shall be formed for periods of
            three months plus up to three additional months if needed as an appeals panel, and no Ambassador shall serve
            on the Conflict Resolution Team more often than once per year. An Ambassador may be excused from the
            Conflict Resolution Team by consent of the Governance Team or the Sponsor in case of a Governance Team
            Ambassador. Failure to participate without being excused may be grounds for termination from the program.
            The Team is responsible for carrying out the Conflict Resolution Process.&nbsp;</li>
        <li>Agenda Team. The Agenda Team is a permanent Ad hoc Team composed of one Representative from each Official
            Team and is responsible for curating the agenda for each General Assembly. The Agenda Team uses a Consent
            Decision process to include proposed Agreements on the agenda for the General Assembly. Each Official Team
            shall designate one Representative to serve on the Agenda Team, and the Representative must be changed at
            least every 6 months.&nbsp;</li>
    </ol>
    <li>Team Elevation. An Ad hoc Team may be elevated to an Official team by a Supermajority Agreement of the General
        Assembly. Elevation of an Ad hoc Team signifies the allocation of an initial Lead Ambassador role assigned to
        that Team once it is an Official Team. The team will not be considered an Official Team until it has elected its
        first Lead Ambassador.</li>
    <li>Dissolution of Teams. An Ad hoc Team may be dissolved at any time by the resignation or failure to participate
        of its members. An Official Team may be dissolved by a Supermajority vote in a General Assembly and with the
        consent of the Sponsor.</li>
    <li>Asset Management. Since the Program does not maintain a treasury, assets exclusively used by the Program are to
        be held by Sponsor for the benefit of and under direction of the Program. (For clarity: other assets used, but
        not exclusively, by the Program may also be held by Sponsor, but operate under the direction of the Sponsor, not
        the Program.)</li>
